/**
 * The Question and Answer service interprets and answers user questions
 * directly based on primary data sources (brochures, web pages, manuals,
 * records, etc.) that have been selected and gathered into a body of data or 'corpus'. The service returns candidate
 * responses with associated confidence levels and links to supporting evidence.
 * The current corpora that are available in <a href="http://www.bluemix.net">Bluemix</a> focus on the Travel and
 * Healthcare industries. Cognitive services learn and improve through training.
 * This beta-level service has no training but shows representative
 * (if not always highly accurate) output. The service is shared to demonstrate
 * how it works. Training the models can improve the results through machine
 * learning.
