/**
 * The Speech to Text service converts the human voice into the written word.
 * This easy-to-use service uses machine intelligence to combine information
 * about grammar and language structure with knowledge of the composition of
 * the audio signal to generate a more accurate transcription. The transcription
 * is continuously sent back to the client and retroactively updated as more
 * speech is heard. Recognition models can be trained for different languages,
 * as well as for specific domains.
