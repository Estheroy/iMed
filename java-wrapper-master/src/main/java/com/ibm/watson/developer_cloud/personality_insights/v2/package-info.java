/**
 * The IBM Watson Personality Insights service uses linguistic analytics to
 * infer cognitive and social characteristics, including Big Five, Values,
 * and Needs, from communications that the user makes available, such as email,
 * text messages, tweets, forum posts, and more. By deriving cognitive and
 * social preferences, the service helps users to understand, connect to,
 * and communicate with other people on a more personalized level.
