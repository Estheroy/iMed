/**
 * The Message Resonance service analyzes draft content and scores

 * This analysis is based on content that has been written by the target
 * audience itself, such as fans of a specific sports team or new parents.
 * Today, analysis can be done against datasets from people active in cloud
 * computing or related discussions, but future versions will let users provide
 * their own community data.
