/**
 * The IBM Watson Tone Analyzer is a service that helps people comprehend, 
 * consume, and revise the language tone of their writing for more efficient 
 * communications or online self-presentation management. Built upon linguistic 
 * analysis, it detects three types of tones from written text: emotions
 * (negative emotions, cheerfulness, anger, and so on), social propensities
 * (openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), and writing styles
 * (analytical, confident, and tentative). It helps people understand how tones
 * are derived from various linguistic signals. It also offers actionable
 * suggestions to revise the writing for desirable tone. Based on the analysis,
 * authors can revise their text to portray the tone that is appropriate for the
 * targeted audience before sending a message, potentially avoiding regrets and
 * miscommunications.
