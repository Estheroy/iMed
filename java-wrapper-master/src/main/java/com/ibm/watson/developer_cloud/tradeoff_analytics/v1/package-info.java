/**
 * The Tradeoff Analytics service helps people optimize their decisions
 * while striking a balance between multiple, often conflicting, objectives.
 * The service can be used to help make complex decisions like what mortgage
 * to take or which laptop to purchase. Tradeoff Analytics uses
 * Pareto filtering techniques to identify the optimal alternatives
 * across multiple criteria. It then uses various analytical and visual
 * approaches to help the decision maker explore the pros and cons of
 * their alternatives.
