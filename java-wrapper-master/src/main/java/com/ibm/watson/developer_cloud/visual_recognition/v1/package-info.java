/**
 * The Visual Recognition service enables you to analyze the visual
 * appearance of images or video frames to understand what is happening.
 * Using machine learning technology, semantic classifiers recognize many
 * visual entities, such as settings, objects, and events. The service applies
 * these models to identify imagery and returns candidate responses with
 * confidence levels.
